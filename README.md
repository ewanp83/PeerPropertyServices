<h2>Peer Property Services</h2>
Website design for Peer Property Services

This website was created for Peer Property Services to allow customers to see what services they offer, the area they cover, view examples of previous work and to make contact.

<h3>UX</h3>
Peer property services wanted a site to allow them to show what services are available to customers, where they operate, to showcase their work and to allow potential customers to make contact.  They also wanted the site to link to their existing facebook and flickr sites. The colour palette is in keeping with their company colours.

The homepage gives an oversight of the company services and where they operate with the text offering reassurance that they are a company that can be relied on. The navbar making it easy to see where to go for more information.

The services page allows the user to access more detailed information about the specific type of service they require with modals specifying the type of work available and the hire us now button to take you straight to the contact page to get in touch or request a quote.

The tesimonials allow the user to see examples of work carried out without bombarding the user with too many pictures or text and the short testimonials next to the images offer reassurance to the user that the company has carried out this work to a high standard and can be relied on.

The hints and tips page will be available to show users how to do certain jobs around the house to keep the work carried out in top condition and for any other useful information the company feels appropriate at the time.

The contact page map shows a general geographical location that the company operate in so that a user can easily see whether they would be able to use the services and a simple contact form to be able to get a quote or to initiate a conversation with the company to discuss a project.

So for example if a user wanted a shower changed, they would land on the homepage, be able to click the services link in the navbar or image and then the plumbing image which would show that the service is offered, click the hire us now button on the modal to link straight to the contact page where they see a map of the coverage area and to fill in the form and get a quote.  Alternately they may wish to view the testimonials page which is easily navigated to as the navbar remains at the top of the page and then go to the contact page or call the company directly using the phone or email link in the footer.

<h3>Features</h3>
1. Modals - The service modals allow the user more detailed information on the various services on offer without having lots of text on the main page creating an easier way to find the information specific to their needs without having to read through lots of irrelevant text.
2. Carousel - The carousel alllows users to view work done on previous projects so that they can see the quality of work and get peace of mind about selecting this company.  It allows Peer Property Services to demonstrate their capabilities and customer reviews without flooding the screen with images and text.
3. Phone and Email links - The links allow the user to make contact with the company with a simple click to get a faster response to any query they may have.

<h4>Features to implement</h4>
When the company has created their own videos these will be added to the hints and tips section in place of the YouTube videos. More slides will be added to the carousel when pictures and testimonials are provided by the company.
The Hints & Tips page can also be used to show customers any special offers the company has found such as deals on materials thst the user may wish to supply as and when they are available.

<h3>Testing</h3>
The site was deployed to Github pages and the link put on Code Institute Slack page for live testing and feedback was observed.  This lead to increasing the size of the menu button on small screens.  

The site was manually tested (following all links and checking for compatability and responsiveness) on a variety of devices inc phones, small and large tablets, laptops and desktops and external monitors.  This lead to changes to layout and body heights etc for different size screens.
Various browsers were used which lead to more padding to be added for example due to IE11 rendering of the page.

All links were tested so that they opened in a new window and where appropriate launched a relative app - ie phone call from the number link and email client from email link.

<h3>Deployment</h3>
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/ewanp83/peerpropertyservices.git into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.
